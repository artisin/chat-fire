# Chat Fire

A chat messenger I created a while back with Graphql/Apollo, React, Redux and Sagas. I've published this code with absolutely no intentions of anything. Who know's maybe you landed on this project via a github search and within you find the answer you're looking for. Please keep in mind I wrote this code a while back so needless to say various parts could be a bit shaky.



## How to run

__Start Server__
```
cd server
npm run start
```

__Start Client__
```
cd client
npm run start
```
